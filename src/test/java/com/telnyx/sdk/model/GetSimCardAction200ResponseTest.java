 * Telnyx 10DLC API
 * # Overview The Telnyx 10DLC API facilitates interaction with The Campaign Registry (TCR), allowing the creation and registration of brands and campaigns with TCR.  # API Interaction ## Request Authorization Telnyx 10DLC API endpoints require authorization for each request. To properly authorize requests, send an Authorization header with `Bearer ` plus your Telnyx API key as the value. See the following curl request for example usage:  ```sh curl --location --request GET 'https://api.telnyx.com/10dlc/example/endpoint' \\  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY_GOES_HERE' \\  --data-raw '' ```  You can obtain your API key by logging into your <a href=\"https://portal.telnyx.com\">Telnyx portal account</a> and clicking the \"API Keys\" tab. From there, you can copy your desired API key for use in your requests, similar to the above example curl request.  ## The 10DLC Work Flow 1. Create a brand  2. Apply for brand vetting  3.
