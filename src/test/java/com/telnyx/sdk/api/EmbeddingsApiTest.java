/*
 * Telnyx 10DLC API
 * # Overview The Telnyx 10DLC API facilitates interaction with The Campaign Registry (TCR), allowing the creation and registration of brands and campaigns with TCR.  # API Interaction ## Request Authorization Telnyx 10DLC API endpoints require authorization for each request. To properly authorize requests, send an Authorization header with `Bearer ` plus your Telnyx API key as the value. See the following curl request for example usage:  ```sh curl --location --request GET 'https://api.telnyx.com/10dlc/example/endpoint' \\  --header 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY_GOES_HERE' \\  --data-raw '' ```  You can obtain your API key by logging into your <a href=\"https://portal.telnyx.com\">Telnyx portal account</a> and clicking the \"API Keys\" tab. From there, you can copy your desired API key for use in your requests, similar to the above example curl request.  ## The 10DLC Work Flow 1. Create a brand  2. Apply for brand vetting  3. Create a campaign or campaigns (associated with the created brand)  4. Assign a phone number or phone numbers to the created campaign ## 10DLC Costs **Brands:** 1. Brand registration: $4 one time charge  2.  Brand vetting: $40 one time charge  **Campaigns:**  1. Campaign registration T-Mobile: $50 one time charge  2. Campaign creation: first 3 month's charge upfront. After the first 3 months, this charge will change to a once a month recurring charge (see charge values below, based on campaign use case)     a. Charity Campaign Use Case: $15 upfront (first 3 months), and $5 month to month after     b. Low Mixed Volume Campaign Use Case: $6 upfront (first 3 months), and $2 month to month after     c. Any Other Campaign Use Case: $30 upfront (first 3 months), and $10 month to month after 3. Phone number to campaign assignment: $0.03 one time charge for each assignment  ## Frequently Asked Questions For frequently asked questions, visit <a href=\"https://support.telnyx.com/en/articles/3679260-frequently-asked-questions-about-10dlc\">Telnyx 10DLC FAQs</a>.

     * Embed documents

     * Perform embedding on a Telnyx Storage Bucket using the a embedding model. The current supported file types are: - PDF - HTML - txt/unstructured text files - json - csv - audio / video (mp3, mp4, mpeg, mpga, m4a, wav, or webm ) - Max of 100mb file size.  Any files not matching the above types will be attempted to be embedded as unstructured text.  This process can be slow, so it runs in the background and the user can check the status of the task using the endpoint &#x60;/ai/embeddings/{task_id}&#x60;.   **Important Note**: When you update documents in a Telnyx Storage bucket, their associated embeddings are automatically kept up to date. If you add or update a file, it is automatically embedded. If you delete a file, the embeddings are deleted for that particular file.  You can also specify a custom &#x60;loader&#x60; param. Currently the only supported loader value is &#x60;intercom&#x60; which loads Intercom article jsons as specified by [the Intercom article API](https://developers.intercom.com/docs/references/rest-api/api.intercom.io/Articles/article/) This loader will split each article into paragraphs and save additional parameters relevant to Intercom docs, such as &#x60;article_url&#x60; and &#x60;heading&#x60;. These values will be returned by the &#x60;/v2/ai/embeddings/similarity-search&#x60; endpoint in the &#x60;loader_metadata&#x60; field.

Currently the only available distance metric is cosine similarity which will return a &#x60;distance&#x60; between 0 and 1. The lower the distance, the more similar the returned document chunks are to the query. A &#x60;certainty&#x60; will also be returned, which is a value between 0 and 1 where the higher the certainty, the more similar the document. You can read more about Weaviate distance metrics here: [Weaviate Docs](https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/config-refs/distances)  If a bucket was embedded using a custom loader, such as &#x60;intercom&#x60;, the additional metadata will be returned in the  &#x60;loader_metadata&#x60; field.
