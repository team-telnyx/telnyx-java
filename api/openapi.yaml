      description: "Call forking allows you to stream the media from a call to a specific\
        \ target in realtime. \nThis stream can be used to enable realtime audio analysis\
        \ to support a \nvariety of use cases, including fraud detection, or the creation\
        \ of AI-generated audio responses. \nRequests must specify either the `target`\
        \ attribute or the `rx` and `tx` attributes.\n\n**Expected Webhooks:**\n\n\
        - `call.fork.started`\n- `call.fork.stopped`\n\n**Simple Telnyx RTP Encapsulation\
        \ Protocol (STREP)**\n\n*Note: This header/encapsulation is not used when\
        \ the `rx` and `tx`\nparameters have been specified; it only applies when\
        \ media is forked\nusing the `target` attribute.*\n\nIf the destination for\
        \ forked media is specified using the \"target\"\nattribute, the RTP will\
        \ be encapsulated in an extra Telnyx protocol,\nwhich adds a 24 byte header\
        \ to the RTP payload in each packet. The STREP\nheader includes the Call Control\
        \ `call_leg_id` for stream\nidentification, along with bits that represent\
        \ the direction (inbound or\noutbound) of the media. This 24-byte header sits\
        \ between the UDP header\nand the RTP header.\n\nThe STREP header makes it\
        \ possible to fork RTP for multiple calls (or\ntwo RTP streams for the same\
        \ call) to the same IP:port, where the\nstreams can be demultiplexed by your\
        \ application using the information\nin the header. Of course, it's still\
        \ possible to ignore this header\ncompletely, for example, if sending forked\
        \ media for different calls to\ndifferent ports or IP addresses. In this case,\
        \ simply strip 24 bytes\n(or use the second byte to find the header length)\
        \ from the received UDP\npayload to get the RTP (RTP header and payload).\n\

        \ Enable the Dialogflow integration by sending `\"enable_dialogflow\": true`\
        \ in the request. You need to have a Dialogflow connection associated with\
        \ your Call Control application first, [click here for instructions](https://developers.telnyx.com/docs/v2/call-control/tutorials/dialogflow-es).\n\

        - `streaming.failed`\n\n**WebSocket events**\n\nWhen the WebSocket connection\
        \ is established, the following event is being sent over it:\n```\n{\n  \"\
        event\": \"connected\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\"\n}\n```\nAnd when the call\
        \ is started, an event which contains information about the encoding and `stream_id`\
        \ that identifies a particular stream:\n```\n{\n  \"event\": \"start\",\n\
        \  \"sequence_number\": \"1\",\n  \"start\": {\n    \"user_id\": \"3e6f995f-85f7-4705-9741-53b116d28237\"\
        ,\n    \"call_control_id\": \"v2:T02llQxIyaRkhfRKxgAP8nY511EhFLizdvdUKJiSw8d6A9BborherQ\"\
        , \n    \"client_state\": \"aGF2ZSBhIG5pY2UgZGF5ID1d\",\n    \"media_format\"\
        : {\n      \"encoding\": \"audio/x-mulaw\",\n      \"sample_rate\": 8000,\n\
        \      \"channels\": 1\n    }\n  },\n  \"stream_id\": \"32de0dea-53cb-4b21-89a4-9e1819c043bc\"\
        \n}\n```\nThe start event is followed by the following media events that contain\
        \ base64-encoded RTP payload (raw audio, no RTP headers) (:\n```\n{ \n  \"\
        event\": \"media\",\n  \"sequence_number\": \"4\",\n  \"media\": { \n    \"\
        track\": \"inbound/outbound\", \n    \"chunk\": \"2\",\n    \"timestamp\"\
        : \"5\",\n    \"payload\": \"no+JhoaJjpzSHxAKBgYJD...IsSbjomGhoqQn1Ic\" \n\
        \  },\n  \"stream_id\": \"32de0dea-53cb-4b21-89a4-9e1819c043bc\" \n}\n```\n\
        Please note that the order of events is not guaranteed and the chunk number\
        \ can be used to reorder the events.\n\nWhen the call ends, the stop event\
        \ over WebSockets connection is sent:\n```\n{ \n  \"event\": \"stop\",\n \
        \ \"sequence_number\": \"5\",\n  \"stop\": {\n    \"user_id\": \"3e6f995f-85f7-4705-9741-53b116d28237\"\

            Mobile network operators connect mobile phone calls and communicate with their market SIM cards using their IMSIs. The IMSI is stored in the Subscriber  Identity Module (SIM) inside the device and is sent by the device to the appropriate network. It is used to acquire the details of the device in the Home  Location Register (HLR) or the Visitor Location Register (VLR).
