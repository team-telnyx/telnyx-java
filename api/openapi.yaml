        Although, a SIM card network preference may fail individually under any validation triggered as a consequence of its state. For example, a SIM can't have an in-progress OTA update for applying a Network Preference, so they'll fail when requested in this API. In that scenario, the specific error will be present in the response along with the successful definitions in the "errors" response node.

        Perform embedding on a Telnyx Storage Bucket using the a embedding model.
        The current supported file types are:
        - PDF
        - HTML
        - txt/unstructured text files
        - json
        - csv
        - audio / video (mp3, mp4, mpeg, mpga, m4a, wav, or webm ) - Max of 100mb file size.

        Any files not matching the above types will be attempted to be embedded as unstructured text.

        This process can be slow, so it runs in the background and the user can check
        the status of the task using the endpoint `/ai/embeddings/{task_id}`.

         **Important Note**: When you update documents in a Telnyx Storage bucket, their associated embeddings are automatically kept up to date. If you add or update a file, it is automatically embedded. If you delete a file, the embeddings are deleted for that particular file.

        You can also specify a custom `loader` param. Currently the only supported loader value is
        `intercom` which loads Intercom article jsons as specified by [the Intercom article API](https://developers.intercom.com/docs/references/rest-api/api.intercom.io/Articles/article/)
        This loader will split each article into paragraphs and save additional parameters relevant to Intercom docs, such as
        `article_url` and `heading`. These values will be returned by the `/v2/ai/embeddings/similarity-search` endpoint in the `loader_metadata` field.

      description: "Call forking allows you to stream the media from a call to a specific\
        \ target in realtime. \nThis stream can be used to enable realtime audio analysis\
        \ to support a \nvariety of use cases, including fraud detection, or the creation\
        \ of AI-generated audio responses. \nRequests must specify either the `target`\
        \ attribute or the `rx` and `tx` attributes.\n\n**Expected Webhooks:**\n\n\
        - `call.fork.started`\n- `call.fork.stopped`\n\n**Simple Telnyx RTP Encapsulation\
        \ Protocol (STREP)**\n\n*Note: This header/encapsulation is not used when\
        \ the `rx` and `tx`\nparameters have been specified; it only applies when\
        \ media is forked\nusing the `target` attribute.*\n\nIf the destination for\
        \ forked media is specified using the \"target\"\nattribute, the RTP will\
        \ be encapsulated in an extra Telnyx protocol,\nwhich adds a 24 byte header\
        \ to the RTP payload in each packet. The STREP\nheader includes the Call Control\
        \ `call_leg_id` for stream\nidentification, along with bits that represent\
        \ the direction (inbound or\noutbound) of the media. This 24-byte header sits\
        \ between the UDP header\nand the RTP header.\n\nThe STREP header makes it\
        \ possible to fork RTP for multiple calls (or\ntwo RTP streams for the same\
        \ call) to the same IP:port, where the\nstreams can be demultiplexed by your\
        \ application using the information\nin the header. Of course, it's still\
        \ possible to ignore this header\ncompletely, for example, if sending forked\
        \ media for different calls to\ndifferent ports or IP addresses. In this case,\
        \ simply strip 24 bytes\n(or use the second byte to find the header length)\
        \ from the received UDP\npayload to get the RTP (RTP header and payload).\n\

      description: "Start streaming the media from a call to a specific WebSocket\
        \ address or Dialogflow connection in near-realtime. Audio will be delivered\
        \ as base64-encoded RTP payload (raw audio), wrapped in JSON payloads. \n\n\
        **Example: Starting a stream to a Websocket address**\n\n The `stream_url`\

        \  https://api.telnyx.com/v2/calls/{call_control_id}/actions/streaming_start\
        \ \n``` \n\n **Example: Starting a stream to a Dialogflow connection** \n\n\
        \ Enable the Dialogflow integration by sending `\"enable_dialogflow\": true`\
        \ in the request. You need to have a Dialogflow connection associated with\

        : true \\ \n}' \\ \n  https://api.telnyx.com/v2/calls/{call_control_id}/actions/streaming_start\
        \ \n```\n\n**Expected Webhooks:**\n\n- `streaming.started`\n- `streaming.stopped`\n\
        - `streaming.failed`\n\n**WebSocket events**\n\nWhen the WebSocket connection\
        \ is established, the following event is being sent over it:\n```\n{\n  \"\
        event\": \"connected\",\n  \"version\": \"1.0.0\"\n}\n```\nAnd when the call\
        \ is started, an event which contains information about the encoding and `stream_id`\
        \ that identifies a particular stream:\n```\n{\n  \"event\": \"start\",\n\
        \  \"sequence_number\": \"1\",\n  \"start\": {\n    \"user_id\": \"3e6f995f-85f7-4705-9741-53b116d28237\"\
        ,\n    \"call_control_id\": \"v3:MdI91X4lWFEs7IgbBEOT9M4AigoY08M0WWZFISt1Yw2axZ_IiE4pqg\"\
        , \n    \"client_state\": \"aGF2ZSBhIG5pY2UgZGF5ID1d\",\n    \"media_format\"\
        : {\n      \"encoding\": \"audio/x-mulaw\",\n      \"sample_rate\": 8000,\n\
        \      \"channels\": 1\n    }\n  },\n  \"stream_id\": \"32de0dea-53cb-4b21-89a4-9e1819c043bc\"\
        \n}\n```\nThe start event is followed by the following media events that contain\
        \ base64-encoded RTP payload (raw audio, no RTP headers) (:\n```\n{ \n  \"\
        event\": \"media\",\n  \"sequence_number\": \"4\",\n  \"media\": { \n    \"\
        track\": \"inbound/outbound\", \n    \"chunk\": \"2\",\n    \"timestamp\"\
        : \"5\",\n    \"payload\": \"no+JhoaJjpzSHxAKBgYJD...IsSbjomGhoqQn1Ic\" \n\
        \  },\n  \"stream_id\": \"32de0dea-53cb-4b21-89a4-9e1819c043bc\" \n}\n```\n\
        Please note that the order of events is not guaranteed and the chunk number\
        \ can be used to reorder the events.\n\nWhen the call ends, the stop event\
        \ over WebSockets connection is sent:\n```\n{ \n  \"event\": \"stop\",\n \
        \ \"sequence_number\": \"5\",\n  \"stop\": {\n    \"user_id\": \"3e6f995f-85f7-4705-9741-53b116d28237\"\
        ,\n    \"call_control_id\": \"v2:T02llQxIyaRkhfRKxgAP8nY511EhFLizdvdUKJiSw8d6A9BborherQ\"\
        \n   },\n    \"stream_id\": \"32de0dea-53cb-4b21-89a4-9e1819c043bc\" \n }\n\
        ```\n\n**Bidirectional Media Streaming**\n\nMedia can be sent back to the\
        \ call through the websocket as well. This is done in a way very similar to\
        \ the [playback_start](https://developers.telnyx.com/docs/api/v2/call-control/Call-Commands#callPlaybackStart)\n\
        command, when using a base64 encoded mp3 file in the payload. Simply send\
        \ a packet to the websocket connection as follows:\n\n```\n{\n  \"event\"\
        : \"media\",\n  \"media\": {\n    \"payload\" : <your base64 encoded mp3 file>\n\
        \  }\n}\n```\n\nThe payload, which is a base64-encoded mp3 file, will be played\
        \ on the call.\n\nSome limitations to be aware of:\n\n- Media payloads can\
        \ only be submitted once per second.\n- Media _must_ be base64 encoded mp3\n\
        \n**Stream Errors**\n\nAny errors in the media packet, including when a rate\
        \ limit is reached, will result in an error frame being\nsent to your websocket\
        \ server. The error frame will appear as follows:\n\n```\n{\n  \"stream_id\"\
        : \"32de0dea-53cb-4b21-89a4-9e1819c043bc\",\n  \"event\": \"error\",\n  \"\
        sequence_number\": \"6\",\n  \"error\": {\n    \"title\": \"rate_limit_reached\"\
        ,\n    \"code\": \"100005\",\n    \"detail\": \"Too many requests\"\n  }\n\
        }\n```\n\nPossible errors are as follows:\n\n- Error 100002: `\"unknown_error\"\
        `\n- Error 100003: `\"malformed_frame\"`\n- Error 100004: `\"invalid_media\"\
        `\n- Error 100005: `\"rate_limit_reached\"`\n"

        Transfer a call to a new destination. If the transfer is unsuccessful, a `call.hangup` webhook for the other call (Leg B) will be sent indicating that the transfer could not be completed. The original call will remain active and may be issued additional commands, potentially transfering the call to an alternate destination.

        **Expected Webhooks:**

        - `call.initiated`
        - `call.bridged` to Leg B
        - `call.answered` or `call.hangup`
        - `call.machine.detection.ended` if `answering_machine_detection` was requested
        - `call.machine.greeting.ended` if `answering_machine_detection` was requested to detect the end of machine greeting
        - `call.machine.premium.detection.ended` if `answering_machine_detection=premium` was requested
        - `call.machine.premium.greeting.ended` if `answering_machine_detection=premium` was requested and a beep was detected

        The SIM card will be able to connect to the network once the process to set it to standby has been completed, thus making it possible to consume data.<br/>
        To set a SIM card to standby, it must be associated with SIM card group.<br/>
        The API will trigger an asynchronous operation called a SIM Card Action. Transitioning to the standby state may take a period of time. The status of the SIM Card Action can be followed through the [List SIM Card Action](https://developersdev.telnyx.com/docs/api/v2/wireless/SIM-Card-Actions#ListSIMCardActions) API.

      description: |
        Number Pool allows you to send messages from a pool of numbers of different types, assigning
        weights to each type. The pool consists of all the long code and toll free numbers
        assigned to the messaging profile.

        To disable this feature, set the object field to `null`.
      example:
        toll_free_weight: 10
        long_code_weight: 1
        skip_unhealthy: true
        sticky_sender: false

        toll_free_weight:
          description: |
            Defines the probability weight for a Toll Free number to be selected when sending a message.
            The higher the weight the higher the probability. The sum of the weights for all number types
            does not necessarily need to add to 100. Weight must be a non-negative number, and when equal
            to zero it will remove the number type from the pool.
          example: 10
          type: number

          description: |
            Defines the probability weight for a Long Code number to be selected when sending a message.
            The higher the weight the higher the probability. The sum of the weights for all number types
            does not necessarily need to add to 100.  Weight must be a non-negative number, and when equal
            to zero it will remove the number type from the pool.

            If set to true all unhealthy numbers will be automatically excluded from the pool.
            Health metrics per number are calculated on a regular basis, taking into account the deliverability
            rate and the amount of messages marked as spam by upstream carriers.
            Numbers with a deliverability rate below 25% or spam ratio over 75% will be considered unhealthy.
          example: true

        sticky_sender:
          default: false
          description: |
            If set to true, Number Pool will try to choose the same sending number for all messages to a particular
            recipient. If the sending number becomes unhealthy and `skip_unhealthy` is set to true, a new
            number will be chosen.

          description: |
            If set to true, Number Pool will try to choose a sending number with the same area code as the destination

            only NANP numbers are supported.

            SIM cards are identified on their individual network operators by a unique International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI). <br/>
            Mobile network operators connect mobile phone calls and communicate with their market SIM cards using their IMSIs. The IMSI is stored in the Subscriber  Identity Module (SIM) inside the device and is sent by the device to the appropriate network. It is used to acquire the details of the device in the Home  Location Register (HLR) or the Visitor Location Register (VLR).
