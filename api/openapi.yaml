- description: "Operations to work with Address records. Address records are emergency-validated\
    \ addresses meant to be associated with phone numbers. They are validated for\
    \ emergency usage purposes at creation time, although you may validate them separately\
    \ with a custom workflow using the ValidateAddress operation separately. Address\
    \ records are not usable for physical orders, such as for Telnyx SIM cards, please\
    \ use UserAddress for that. It is not possible to entirely skip emergency service\
    \ validation for Address records; if an emergency provider for a phone number\
    \ rejects the address then it cannot be used on a phone number. To prevent records\
    \ from getting out of sync, Address records are immutable and cannot be altered\
    \ once created. If you realize you need to alter an address, a new record must\
    \ be created with the differing address."

        Perform embedding on a Telnyx Storage Bucket using the a embedding model.
        The current supported file types are:
        - PDF
        - HTML
        - txt/unstructured text files
        - json
        - csv
        - audio / video (mp3, mp4, mpeg, mpga, m4a, wav, or webm ) - Max of 100mb file size.

        Any files not matching the above types will be attempted to be embedded as unstructured text.

        This process can be slow, so it runs in the background and the user can check
        the status of the task using the endpoint `/ai/embeddings/{task_id}`.

         **Important Note**: When you update documents in a Telnyx Storage bucket, their associated embeddings are automatically kept up to date. If you add or update a file, it is automatically embedded. If you delete a file, the embeddings are deleted for that particular file.

        You can also specify a custom `loader` param. Currently the only supported loader value is
        `intercom` which loads Intercom article jsons as specified by [the Intercom article API](https://developers.intercom.com/docs/references/rest-api/api.intercom.io/Articles/article/)
        This loader will split each article into paragraphs and save additional parameters relevant to Intercom docs, such as
        `article_url` and `heading`. These values will be returned by the `/v2/ai/embeddings/similarity-search` endpoint in the `loader_metadata` field.

        Transfer a call to a new destination. If the transfer is unsuccessful, a `call.hangup` webhook for the other call (Leg B) will be sent indicating that the transfer could not be completed. The original call will remain active and may be issued additional commands, potentially transfering the call to an alternate destination.

        **Expected Webhooks (see [callback schema](https://developers.telnyx.com/api/call-control/transfer-call#callbacks) below):**

        - `call.initiated`
        - `call.bridged` to Leg B
        - `call.answered` or `call.hangup`
        - `call.machine.detection.ended` if `answering_machine_detection` was requested
        - `call.machine.greeting.ended` if `answering_machine_detection` was requested to detect the end of machine greeting
        - `call.machine.premium.detection.ended` if `answering_machine_detection=premium` was requested
        - `call.machine.premium.greeting.ended` if `answering_machine_detection=premium` was requested and a beep was detected

            SIM cards are identified on their individual network operators by a unique International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI). <br/>
            Mobile network operators connect mobile phone calls and communicate with their market SIM cards using their IMSIs. The IMSI is stored in the Subscriber  Identity Module (SIM) inside the device and is sent by the device to the appropriate network. It is used to acquire the details of the device in the Home  Location Register (HLR) or the Visitor Location Register (VLR).

         **Supported Providers:**
        - **AWS:** Use `AWS.Polly.<VoiceId>` (e.g., `AWS.Polly.Joanna`). For neural voices, which provide more realistic, human-like speech, append `-Neural` to the `VoiceId` (e.g., `AWS.Polly.Joanna-Neural`). Check the [available voices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/available-voices.html) for compatibility.
        - **Azure:** Use `Azure.<VoiceId>. (e.g. Azure.en-CA-ClaraNeural, Azure.en-CA-LiamNeural, Azure.en-US-BrianMultilingualNeural, Azure.en-US-AvaMultilingualNeural. For a complete list of voices, go to [Azure Voice Gallery](https://speech.microsoft.com/portal/voicegallery).)
        - **ElevenLabs:** Use `ElevenLabs.<ModelId>.<VoiceId>` (e.g., `ElevenLabs.BaseModel.John`). The `ModelId` part is optional. To use ElevenLabs, you must provide your ElevenLabs API key as an integration secret under `"voice_settings": {"api_key_ref": "<secret_id>"}`. See [integration secrets documentation](https://developers.telnyx.com/api/secrets-manager/integration-secrets/create-integration-secret) for details.

            The voice to be used by the voice assistant. Currently we support ElevenLabs, Telnyx and AWS voices.

             **Supported Providers:**
            - **AWS:** Use `AWS.Polly.<VoiceId>` (e.g., `AWS.Polly.Joanna`). For neural voices, which provide more realistic, human-like speech, append `-Neural` to the `VoiceId` (e.g., `AWS.Polly.Joanna-Neural`). Check the [available voices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/available-voices.html) for compatibility.
            - **Azure:** Use `Azure.<VoiceId>. (e.g. Azure.en-CA-ClaraNeural, Azure.en-CA-LiamNeural, Azure.en-US-BrianMultilingualNeural, Azure.en-US-AvaMultilingualNeural. For a complete list of voices, go to [Azure Voice Gallery](https://speech.microsoft.com/portal/voicegallery).)
            - **ElevenLabs:** Use `ElevenLabs.<ModelId>.<VoiceId>` (e.g., `ElevenLabs.BaseModel.John`). The `ModelId` part is optional. To use ElevenLabs, you must provide your ElevenLabs API key as an integration secret under `"voice_settings": {"api_key_ref": "<secret_id>"}`. See [integration secrets documentation](https://developers.telnyx.com/api/secrets-manager/integration-secrets/create-integration-secret) for details. Check [available voices](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/api-reference/get-voices).
             - **Telnyx:** Use `Telnyx.<model_id>.<voice_id>`

            - Define voices using the format `<Provider>.<Model>.<VoiceId>`. Specifying only the provider will give default values for voice_id and model_id.

             **Supported Providers:**
            - **AWS:** Use `AWS.Polly.<VoiceId>` (e.g., `AWS.Polly.Joanna`). For neural voices, which provide more realistic, human-like speech, append `-Neural` to the `VoiceId` (e.g., `AWS.Polly.Joanna-Neural`). Check the [available voices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/available-voices.html) for compatibility.
            - **Azure:** Use `Azure.<VoiceId>. (e.g. Azure.en-CA-ClaraNeural, Azure.en-CA-LiamNeural, Azure.en-US-BrianMultilingualNeural, Azure.en-US-AvaMultilingualNeural. For a complete list of voices, go to [Azure Voice Gallery](https://speech.microsoft.com/portal/voicegallery).)
            - **ElevenLabs:** Use `ElevenLabs.<ModelId>.<VoiceId>` (e.g., `ElevenLabs.eleven_multilingual_v2.21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM`). The `ModelId` part is optional. To use ElevenLabs, you must provide your ElevenLabs API key as an integration identifier secret in `"voice_settings": {"api_key_ref": "<secret_identifier>"}`. See [integration secrets documentation](https://developers.telnyx.com/api/secrets-manager/integration-secrets/create-integration-secret) for details. Check [available voices](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/api-reference/get-voices).
             - **Telnyx:** Use `Telnyx.<model_id>.<voice_id>`

            For service_level basic, you may define the gender of the speaker (male or female).

            - Define voices using the format `<Provider>.<Model>.<VoiceId>`. Specifying only the provider will give default values for voice_id and model_id.

             **Supported Providers:**
            - **AWS:** Use `AWS.Polly.<VoiceId>` (e.g., `AWS.Polly.Joanna`). For neural voices, which provide more realistic, human-like speech, append `-Neural` to the `VoiceId` (e.g., `AWS.Polly.Joanna-Neural`). Check the [available voices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/available-voices.html) for compatibility.
            - **Azure:** Use `Azure.<VoiceId>. (e.g. Azure.en-CA-ClaraNeural, Azure.en-CA-LiamNeural, Azure.en-US-BrianMultilingualNeural, Azure.en-US-AvaMultilingualNeural. For a complete list of voices, go to [Azure Voice Gallery](https://speech.microsoft.com/portal/voicegallery).)
            - **ElevenLabs:** Use `ElevenLabs.<ModelId>.<VoiceId>` (e.g., `ElevenLabs.eleven_multilingual_v2.21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM`). The `ModelId` part is optional. To use ElevenLabs, you must provide your ElevenLabs API key as an integration identifier secret in `"voice_settings": {"api_key_ref": "<secret_identifier>"}`. See [integration secrets documentation](https://developers.telnyx.com/api/secrets-manager/integration-secrets/create-integration-secret) for details. Check [available voices](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/api-reference/get-voices).
             - **Telnyx:** Use `Telnyx.<model_id>.<voice_id>`

            For service_level basic, you may define the gender of the speaker (male or female).

Check the [available voices](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/polly/latest/dg/available-voices.html) for compatibility.
            - **Azure:** Use `Azure.<VoiceId>. (e.g. Azure.en-CA-ClaraNeural, Azure.en-CA-LiamNeural, Azure.en-US-BrianMultilingualNeural, Azure.en-US-AvaMultilingualNeural. For a complete list of voices, go to [Azure Voice Gallery](https://speech.microsoft.com/portal/voicegallery).)
            - **ElevenLabs:** Use `ElevenLabs.<ModelId>.<VoiceId>` (e.g., `ElevenLabs.eleven_multilingual_v2.21m00Tcm4TlvDq8ikWAM`). The `ModelId` part is optional. To use ElevenLabs, you must provide your ElevenLabs API key as an integration identifier secret in `"voice_settings": {"api_key_ref": "<secret_identifier>"}`. See [integration secrets documentation](https://developers.telnyx.com/api/secrets-manager/integration-secrets/create-integration-secret) for details. Check [available voices](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/api-reference/get-voices).
             - **Telnyx:** Use `Telnyx.<model_id>.<voice_id>`

            For service_level basic, you may define the gender of the speaker (male or female).

            The higher the weight the higher the probability. The sum of the weights for all number types
            does not necessarily need to add to 100. Weight must be a non-negative number, and when equal
            to zero it will remove the number type from the pool.

            SIM cards are identified on their individual network operators by a unique International Mobile Subscriber Identity (IMSI). <br/>
            Mobile network operators connect mobile phone calls and communicate with their market SIM cards using their IMSIs. The IMSI is stored in the Subscriber  Identity Module (SIM) inside the device and is sent by the device to the appropriate network. It is used to acquire the details of the device in the Home  Location Register (HLR) or the Visitor Location Register (VLR).
