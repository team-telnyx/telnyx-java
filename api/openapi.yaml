      description: "Call forking allows you to stream the media from a call to a specific\
        \ target in realtime. \nThis stream can be used to enable realtime audio analysis\
        \ to support a \nvariety of use cases, including fraud detection, or the creation\
        \ of AI-generated audio responses. \nRequests must specify either the `target`\
        \ attribute or the `rx` and `tx` attributes.\n\n**Expected Webhooks:**\n\n\
        - `call.fork.started`\n- `call.fork.stopped`\n\n**Simple Telnyx RTP Encapsulation\
        \ Protocol (STREP)**\n\n*Note: This header/encapsulation is not used when\
        \ the `rx` and `tx`\nparameters have been specified; it only applies when\
        \ media is forked\nusing the `target` attribute.*\n\nIf the destination for\
        \ forked media is specified using the \"target\"\nattribute, the RTP will\
        \ be encapsulated in an extra Telnyx protocol,\nwhich adds a 24 byte header\
        \ to the RTP payload in each packet. The STREP\nheader includes the Call Control\
        \ `call_leg_id` for stream\nidentification, along with bits that represent\
        \ the direction (inbound or\noutbound) of the media. This 24-byte header sits\
        \ between the UDP header\nand the RTP header.\n\nThe STREP header makes it\
        \ possible to fork RTP for multiple calls (or\ntwo RTP streams for the same\
        \ call) to the same IP:port, where the\nstreams can be demultiplexed by your\
        \ application using the information\nin the header. Of course, it's still\
        \ possible to ignore this header\ncompletely, for example, if sending forked\
        \ media for different calls to\ndifferent ports or IP addresses. In this case,\
        \ simply strip 24 bytes\n(or use the second byte to find the header length)\
        \ from the received UDP\npayload to get the RTP (RTP header and payload).\n\

        Convert text to speech and play it on the call until the required DTMF signals are gathered to build interactive menus.

        You can pass a list of valid digits along with an 'invalid_payload', which will be played back at the beginning of each prompt. Speech will be interrupted when a DTMF signal is received. The [Answer](/docs/api/v2/call-control/Call-Commands#CallControlAnswer) command must be issued before the `gather_using_speak` command.

    NumberPoolSettings:
      description: |
        Number Pool allows you to send messages from a pool of numbers of different types, assigning
        weights to each type. The pool consists of all the long code and toll free numbers
        assigned to the messaging profile.

        To disable this feature, set the object field to `null`.
      example:
        toll_free_weight: 10
        long_code_weight: 1
        skip_unhealthy: true
        sticky_sender: false
        geomatch: false
      nullable: true
      properties:
        toll_free_weight:
          description: |
            Defines the probability weight for a Toll Free number to be selected when sending a message.
            The higher the weight the higher the probability. The sum of the weights for all number types
            does not necessarily need to add to 100. Weight must be a non-negative number, and when equal
            to zero it will remove the number type from the pool.
          example: 10
          type: number
        long_code_weight:
          description: |
            Defines the probability weight for a Long Code number to be selected when sending a message.
            The higher the weight the higher the probability. The sum of the weights for all number types
            does not necessarily need to add to 100.  Weight must be a non-negative number, and when equal
            to zero it will remove the number type from the pool.
          example: 1
          type: number
        skip_unhealthy:
          description: |
            If set to true all unhealthy numbers will be automatically excluded from the pool.
            Health metrics per number are calculated on a regular basis, taking into account the deliverability
            rate and the amount of messages marked as spam by upstream carriers.
            Numbers with a deliverability rate below 25% or spam ratio over 75% will be considered unhealthy.
          example: true
          type: boolean
        sticky_sender:
          default: false
          description: |
            If set to true, Number Pool will try to choose the same sending number for all messages to a particular
            recipient. If the sending number becomes unhealthy and `skip_unhealthy` is set to true, a new
            number will be chosen.
          type: boolean
        geomatch:
          default: false
          description: |
            If set to true, Number Pool will try to choose a sending number with the same area code as the destination
            number. If there are no such numbers available, a nunber with a different area code will be chosen. Currently
            only NANP numbers are supported.
