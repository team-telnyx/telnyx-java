    "description": "Before creating a campaign, use the [Qualify By Usecase endpoint](https://developers.telnyx.com/api/messaging/10dlc/get-usecase-qualification) to ensure that the brand you want to assign a new campaign to is qualified for the desired use case of that campaign. **Please note:** After campaign creation, you'll only be able to edit the campaign's sample messages. Creating a campaign will entail an upfront, non-refundable three month's cost that will depend on the campaign's use case ([see 10DLC Costs section for details](https://developers.telnyx.com/docs/messaging/10dlc/concepts#10dlc-costs)).",
