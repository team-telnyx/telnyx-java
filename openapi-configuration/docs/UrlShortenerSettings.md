# UrlShortenerSettings

The URL shortener feature allows automatic replacement of URLs that were generated using a public URL shortener service. Some examples include bit.do, bit.ly, goo.gl, ht.ly, is.gd, ow.ly, rebrand.ly, t.co, tiny.cc, and tinyurl.com. Such URLs are replaced with with links generated by Telnyx. The use of custom links can improve branding and message deliverability.  To disable this feature, set the object field to `null`.
