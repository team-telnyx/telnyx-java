|**callControlId** | **String** | Unique identifier and token for controlling the call |  |
|**clientState** | **String** | Use this field to add state to every subsequent webhook. It must be a valid Base-64 encoded string. Please note that the client_state will be updated for the participient call leg and the change will not affect conferencing webhooks unless the participient is the owner of the conference. |  [optional] |
|**commandId** | **String** | Use this field to avoid execution of duplicate commands. Telnyx will ignore subsequent commands with the same &#x60;command_id&#x60; as one that has already been executed. |  [optional] |
|**endConferenceOnExit** | **Boolean** | Whether the conference should end and all remaining participants be hung up after the participant leaves the conference. Defaults to \&quot;false\&quot;. |  [optional] |
|**softEndConferenceOnExit** | **Boolean** | Whether the conference should end after the participant leaves the conference. NOTE this doesn&#39;t hang up the other participants. Defaults to \&quot;false\&quot;. |  [optional] |
|**hold** | **Boolean** | Whether the participant should be put on hold immediately after joining the conference. Defaults to \&quot;false\&quot;. |  [optional] |
|**holdAudioUrl** | **String** | The URL of a file to be played to the participant when they are put on hold after joining the conference. hold_media_name and hold_audio_url cannot be used together in one request. Takes effect only when \&quot;start_conference_on_create\&quot; is set to \&quot;false\&quot;. This property takes effect only if \&quot;hold\&quot; is set to \&quot;true\&quot;. |  [optional] |
|**holdMediaName** | **String** | The media_name of a file to be played to the participant when they are put on hold after joining the conference. The media_name must point to a file previously uploaded to api.telnyx.com/v2/media by the same user/organization. The file must either be a WAV or MP3 file.

|**supervisorRole** | [**SupervisorRoleEnum**](#SupervisorRoleEnum) | Sets the joining participant as a supervisor for the conference. A conference can have multiple supervisors. \&quot;barge\&quot; means the supervisor enters the conference as a normal participant. This is the same as \&quot;none\&quot;. \&quot;monitor\&quot; means the supervisor is muted but can hear all participants. \&quot;whisper\&quot; means that only the specified \&quot;whisper_call_control_ids\&quot; can hear the supervisor. Defaults to \&quot;none\&quot;. |  [optional] |
|**whisperCallControlIds** | **List&lt;String&gt;** | Array of unique call_control_ids the joining supervisor can whisper to. If none provided, the supervisor will join the conference as a monitoring participant only. |  [optional] |
